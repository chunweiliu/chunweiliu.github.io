Welcome! This site is currently hosting

* projects on GitHub;
* thoughts on softwares/programming;
* and life logs as a software engineer.

The main goal of this site is to practice my organization and expression skills through jogging down my thought to these topics. Meanwhile, I look forward to discussion on these topics and learning from the audience across the world.  

This is a hard task to me. But I will try to make it work.
