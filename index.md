I am a [graduate student](https://cs.unc.edu/~chunwei/) studying in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Born and grew up in Taiwan, where I lived for a quarter of century. I moved to the USA at the state of North Carolina for pursuing my master degree and future career in computer science. I love to jog down my life by [words](https://chunweiliu.wordpress.com) (Chinese) and [photos](https://instagram.com/chunweiliu/).
